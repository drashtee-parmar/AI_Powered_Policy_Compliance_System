A: Based on the provided policies, there are no explicit instructions given on how a cardholder can temporarily freeze their card. However, in regards to fraud protection (Policy 1, Section 6), it is mentioned that the issuer employs real-time fraud monitoring tools. If suspicious activity is detected, the cardholder is notified via email or SMS. If the cardholder doesn't confirm the activity within 24 hours, his/her card may be temporarily suspended. This could be indirectly interpreted as a de facto way to freeze the card, albeit not initiated directly by the cardholder.

One might also infer from the policy on Termination of Agreement (Policy 1, Section 8) that a cardholder could initiate a temporary freeze, but the text only specifies the process for complete termination, not a freeze. It is recommended that the cardholder gets in touch directly with the card issuer or refers to other parts of their agreement that specifically address how to temporarily freeze the card.
