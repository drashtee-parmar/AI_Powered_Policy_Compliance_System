A: Yes, there are penalties for late payments. According to Policy 1: Cardholder Agreement Terms, Section 3: Billing and Payments, if a cardholder fails to make the minimum payment by the due date, a late fee of $39 is applied. Furthermore, as stated in Policy 1: Cardholder Agreement Terms, Section 2: Interest Rates and Fees, if a cardholder misses two consecutive payments, their annual percentage rate (APR) will increase to 29.99% from the standard rate.

Q: how much interest charge for late
A: Based on Policy 1: Cardholder Agreement Terms, if a payment is late, the cardholder is required to pay a late fee of $39. Additionally, interest begins to accrue on the outstanding balance. The standard Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for purchases is 19.99%, which applies to any unpaid balance after the billing cycle ends. If a cardholder misses two consecutive payments, the APR will increase to 29.99%. The penalty APR is applied until six consecutive on-time payments are made, at which point the rate will revert to the standard APR.
On the other hand, Policy 6: Foreign Transaction Fees and Currency Conversion Policy states that cash withdrawals from foreign ATMs begin accruing interest immediately at an APR of 24.99%. There is no grace period for cash advances in foreign countries.
So, the exact interest that would be applied would be dependent on the type of transaction (purchase or cash advance) and whether any payments have been missed.
