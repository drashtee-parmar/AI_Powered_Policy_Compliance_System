      "\n",
      "Policy 6 - Foreign Transaction Fees and Currency Conversion:\n",
      "- A 3% foreign transaction fee is applied to all purchases made in a foreign currency or outside the cardholder‚Äôs home country.\n",
      "- Currency conversion is automatic, and the exchange rate is set by the card network (for example, Visa or MasterCard).\n",
      "- There are additional fees for cash withdrawals from foreign ATMs. Interest begins accruing right away at 24.99% APR with no grace period.\n",
      "- If a foreign purchase is refunded, the refund amount may differ due to exchange rate fluctuations.\n",
      "- Cardholders are encouraged to notify the issuer of their travel plans to avoid card suspension.\n",
      "- Discrepancies in foreign transactions must be reported within 60 days from the statement date and proper documentation is required.\n",
      "- There are daily transaction limits for foreign purchases and foreign ATM withdrawals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Policy 1 - Cardholder Agreement Terms \n",
      "- The card is only for personal use, and misuse may result in termination.\n",
      "- The maximum credit limit is $10,000 for standard cardholders.\n",
      "- The standard APR for purchases is 19.99% and a higher APR of 24.99% applies to cash advances.\n",
      "- Fraud protection is in place, and card users aren't held responsible for unauthorized transactions.\n",
      "- Cardholders can terminate their agreement at any time by paying off the outstanding balance and sending a written notice to the issuer.\n",
      "- The issuer can modify the agreement terms with a 30 days' notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Policy 8 - Promotional Offers and Balance Transfers\n",
      "- New cardholders may get a 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 12 and 18 months respectively.\n",
      "- There are ongoing promotional offers like double points during certain periods.\n",
      "- Missed payments result in forfeiture of the promotional APR offer.\n",
      "- Balance transfers, during the promotional period, incur an initial fee of 3%.\n",
      "- At the end of any promotional period, remaining balances will revert to the standard APRs.\n",
      "- The issuer can amend or discontinue promotional offers with 30 days' notice.\n",

Additionally, interest begins to accrue on the outstanding balance. The standard Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for purchases is 19.99%, which applies to any unpaid balance after the billing cycle ends. If a cardholder misses two consecutive payments, the APR will increase to 29.99%. The penalty APR is applied until six consecutive on-time payments are made, at which point the rate will revert to the standard APR.\n",
